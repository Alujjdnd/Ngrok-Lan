### Hi everyone,

It's Flooflez, the Maintainer of Ngrok-LAN.
I am writing this to let everyone know that I have decided to not continue the development of this mod. 

I will explain why I have made this decision in this document, but if you are looking for alternatives for other versions of Minecraft I highly recommend the following mods:

| Mod          | Description                                                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [e4mc](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc)         | Doesn't require Ngrok, kept up to date, super easy to use                            |
| [Custom LAN](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-lan)   | Added Ngrok support based on this mod, tons of extra features to control your worlds |

### A brief explanation about the state of this mod
This mod was created as a consistent method for my friends and I to play together without having a proper server. I don't know if it was the first of its kind, but for us it was the only way to allow us to play together.

This was the first time my friend and I had coded a Minecraft mod, so this thing is built on really messy, unreadable code. Frankly, it's a miracle that this thing made it to 1.20 without any major rewrites. 

This mod didn't get the popularity we thought it would, but in hindsight it's obvious why it never took off. The UI is weird, the name is vague about its functions, and the setup is difficult for people who are expecting to just download a mod and have everything work.

Now that Minecraft, Fabric, and Ngrok have had major changes to their internal technologies, it's simply not worth worth keeping this buggy mess up to date, especially when it's not making me money and there are better alternatives out there now. I'm also just not interested in maintaining this anymore when I could be making more interesting things. 

### What now?
So what will happen to this mod? For all intents and purposes it is now **deprecated**.

With people now getting Ngrok errors, there are likely more issues to come with time. Hence, I *highly recommend* that you do not use this mod anymore.

That being said, this is definetly not the end of my modding career, as I will still be making projects here on Github, as well as on Modrinth and Curseforge. If you would like to continue your support, feel free to check out my other projects :) of course always free to download.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project throughout the years, and I hope that we've been able to let people reconnect with others, build relationships and strengthen friendships through our silly little mod.
